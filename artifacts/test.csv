Today's Top Spotlight Game
Braves vs Reds by James Boutros













The Atlanta Braves will be on the road as they take on the Cincinnati Reds. Jared Shuster will take the mound for the Braves. Granot spam Ashcraft is expected to be the starting pitcher for the Reds. Jared Shuster is expected to start for the Braves. He went 5.2 innings and gave up five hits, three walks, one earned run, and struck out two in a win in his last start against the Colorado Rockies. On the season, he has a record of 4-2 with a 4.57 ERA, 1.38 WHIP, and a 23/22 K/BB ratio in eight starts. Opposing batters are hitting .233 against Shuster.

The Braves have been very good on offense this season. They are top 10 in the league in runs, hits, home runs, RBIs, batting average, OBP, SLG, and OPS. Matt Olson leads the team in home runs. Ronald Acuna leads the team in runs, hits, and stolen bases. Acuna is top five in the MLB in runs, hits, and stolen bases... CLICK HERE to finish reading and see our PREDICTION on this contest.

Today's Spotlight Game #2
Astros vs Dodgers by Andre' IFill  
 





For anyone with chores on Saturday, take out the trash early. The Houston Astros (41-34) and Los Angeles Dodgers (41-33) are set to bang on Saturday night as they continue their weekend series. Dodger Stadium is hosting, and there won't be a shortage of cameras catching every angle. The first pitch on Saturday is scheduled for 7:15 p.m. EDT and FOX will have the broadcast as they did for their infamous 2017 World Series battle. These two dugouts will do whatever it takes for a win right now, as they are both barely clinging to playoff spots. Let's see the lengths they're willing to go.




There isn't a club in the majors with a lower ERA than the Houston Astros. The bullpen is impressive, with top 10 marks in ERA, FIP, and WAR. However, the starting rotation is how the Astros won it all last season, and they've also been stellar in 2023. Unfortunately, injuries have taken their toll, thrusting Ronel Blanco into the rotation temporarily. As a starter this season, he's thrown 17.0 innings. In that time, he's allowed 17 hits, nine walks, five homers, and nine earned runs. His road ERA is 6.30, mostly due to one disastrous relief appearance in April... CLICK HERE to finish reading and see our PREDICTION on this contest. 

Another day, another solid 2-1 performance from Mike “Big Game” Briggs, running his major league heater to 14-4 in his last 18 Premium Plays. No one has spent more time atop the leaderboard than Briggs and if you haven’t given him a shot, today’s 100% GUARANTEED MLB MAX UNIT MONSTER is the perfect opportunity to do just that. This game goes at 1:10 ET and it is just $24.00. CLICK HERE
Insider's Exclusive Pick
We Got Back On Track Yesterday
Our Freebie yesterday was on the Under 9 in the Minnesota/ Detroit game and it was an easy winner as just five runs were scored in the contest. We will look to Keep It Rolling today with a FREE play from Caleb Davis.  

Free Pick: Angels/ Rockies Over 12











The Angels have been able to hit the long ball well all season, and during night games they've managed to do so even more. Colorado is sitting right around the top 10 in overall batting average and appears to have found their swing of late, racking up 13 runs in their last three games and hitting 21 homers in 20 June contests. Colorado isn't foreign to giving up runs either and with the Angels' ability to drive runners in they should do so. Canning has had ball control issues at times this season and if the Rockies are able to make him work on the mound, they should like their chances to continue their hot hitting. Take the over.
